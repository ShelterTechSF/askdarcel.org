          <p>
            I became homeless when I was injured and lost my welding job working
            on the new Bay Bridge in San Francisco. I realized the longer I
            stayed in that condition, the harder it would become to escape it.
            Living on the streets, you spend most of your time just trying to
            survive. Itâ€™s hard to know where to start, what services you need,
            how to get training in a new field or search for jobs. I had a
            smartphone and could find WiFi, but there weren't any apps or
            websites to help me get off the streets. Now I want to give back and
            help people that become homeless. Darcel founded ShelterTech to help
            bridge this digital divide.
