          <p>
            On this #GivingTuesday, we ask that you reflect on how important
            internet access is in your daily life. As weâ€™ve shifted to a
            socially-distanced reality dependent on WiFi, many of us have been
            able to conduct Zoom calls to talk to our loved ones and coworkers,
            purchase deliverable groceries and take-out, and stream our favorite
            shows and movies. People experiencing homelessness often do not have
            internet access, making it harder to do all of these things.
          </p>
          <p>
            At ShelterTech, we believe connectivity is a right, not a privilege,
            and through our ShelterConnect program, we have installed free WiFi
            at a number of San Francisco-based shelters to help bridge this
            digital divide. You can learn more about ShelterConnect by watching
            our video{" "}

            Last year, <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>you</span> and
            other supporters gave contributions which enabled ShelterTech to
            provide WiFi internet connectivity to hundreds of individuals
            experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity in San Francisco.
            With our partners, the City of San Francisco and Cisco, providing at
            no cost the broadband and network equipment, respectively,
            ShelterTech funded installation costs to costs to outfit two
            shelters, the{" "}
