            On this #GivingTuesday, we ask that you reflect on how important
            internet access is in your daily life. As weâ€™ve shifted to a
            socially-distanced reality dependent on WiFi, many of us have been
            able to conduct Zoom calls to talk to our loved ones and coworkers,
            purchase deliverable groceries and take-out, and stream our favorite
            shows and movies. People experiencing homelessness often do not have
            internet access, making it harder to do all of these things.
          </span>,
          <span>
            At ShelterTech, we believe connectivity is a right, not a privilege,
            and through our ShelterConnect program, we have installed free WiFi
            at a number of San Francisco-based shelters to help bridge this
            digital divide. You can learn more about ShelterConnect by watching
            our video&nbsp;
