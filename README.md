## Staging website

We're currently in the process of developing a redesign of the sheltertech.org
website! Until we are done and ready to flip the switch to the new design, we
will be placing the new site pages under the `/new` URL path so that they can be
easily previewed before we roll them out to the main site page routing.

To view the current state of the new design on the staging website, please visit
https://staging.sheltertech.org/new.
